    "description": "Introducing BloodBank, my proud side project aimed at helping patients in need of blood. The idea behind BloodBank came after I discovered the disturbing fact that \"up to 38,000 blood donations are needed each year\". BloodBank connects users who require blood with those willing to donate. Users can easily find donors and requests based on blood type and location. Whenever a blood request is made, BloodBank sends out emails to potential donors in the vicinity, hoping for their support. BloodBank is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack and has already attracted over 1000 users across Nepal.",
